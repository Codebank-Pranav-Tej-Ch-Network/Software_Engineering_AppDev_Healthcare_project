🎯 About The Project
In line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Good Health and Well-being, Green-Health aims to provide an accessible, all-in-one platform for health management. Our project addresses this goal through several key pillars:

Personal Health Management: Empowering individuals with tools to track their health records, medications, and fitness goals.

Community Health: Fostering a community of support through features like blood donation and resource sharing.

Medical Sustainability: Reducing medical waste by creating a platform for recycling near-expiry medicines.

AI-Driven Insights: Providing accessible health analysis through cutting-edge AI to guide users toward appropriate medical care.

🚀 Key Features
Green-Health comes packed with a range of features designed to cater to all aspects of a user's health journey.

🔐 Seamless Authentication

Secure and easy-to-use login and sign-up flow powered by Firebase Authentication.

👤 Personalized User Profiles

A dedicated space for users to manage their personal information and preferences.

🗂️ Healthset Wallet

A secure digital wallet to upload, store, and manage custom image files of medical documents like lab reports, test results, and prescriptions. Never lose a report again!

🩸 Blood Donation Platform

A community-driven feature where users can register as willing blood donors. Those in need can easily view a list of potential donors in their vicinity, bridging a critical gap in emergency situations.

💊 Intelligent Medication Reminders

A simple yet powerful reminder system to help users manage their medication schedules effectively. Add medications, set timings, and receive timely notifications.

🤸 Guided Diet & Exercise Plans

An engaging list of animated cards showcasing various yoga poses and exercises. Each card links to trusted external resources for detailed information, helping users stay active and informed.

♻️ Hyperlocal Medical Waste Reduction

A unique peer-to-peer platform where users can list and sell medicines that are nearing their expiry date at custom prices. This promotes the recycling of safe, unused medication and reduces waste.

🤖 AI-Powered Health Analysis

Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini API, users can upload an image of a test report. Our AI/ML pipeline analyzes the report to provide a simplified summary, identify potential symptoms, and suggest which type of specialist (e.g., Cardiologist, Endocrinologist) to consult.
